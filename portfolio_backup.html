      <h1>Selected Projects</h1>
      <p>Here are some of the exciting projects I've been working on, blending education, technology, and creativity to
        make learning musical instruments more fun and engaging.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <img src="assets/mei-logo.png" alt="MEI-Trumpet Landscape Cover" class="cover-image"
        style="margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

      <p><strong>MEI-Trumpet</strong> is an educational web application that supports users in mastering musical
        competencies. The app facilitates learning through guided repetition, structured reflection, and multi-sensory
        engagement, addressing critical technical and auditory skills.</p>
      <p>By allowing students to set custom parameters, MEI-Trumpet adapts to different skill levels, creating a
        <strong>personalized learning experience</strong>.
        Starting with a beginner-friendly interface, users can customize their practice by selecting:</p>

      <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 20px;">
        <li>⏰ <strong>Metronome Speed:</strong> Adjust the tempo for practice.</li>
        <li>🎵 <strong>Lowest Note & Highest Note:</strong> Define a custom range of notes to focus on.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The image below shows the interactive controls where students can set these parameters before starting an
        exercise.</p>

      <div class="input-video">
        <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
          <source src="assets/input_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
      </div>

      <p>Each exercise is structured in three steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first measure is a rest, allowing the student to prepare</li>
        <li>The second measure plays a reference note, offering an example to imitate</li>
        <li>The third measure is for the user to play the note</li>
      </ul>

      <p>On the top of the screen, an image showing the correct trumpet fingering, including adjustments for the third
        valve slide, is displayed. This helps students easily associate the note shown on the musical staff with the
        corresponding pitch and valve combination.</p>

      <h2>Advancing Your Skills!</h2>
      <p>Once users get the hang of playing the right note, scaffolding helps them take it to the next level!
      <p>
      <h3>Intonation and Dynamics</h3>
      <p>Adding a chromatic tuner and dynamic markings, users are encouraged to fine-tune their pitch and volume control
        bringing more expression and style to their playing.</p>
      <div class="app-screenshots">
        <img src="assets/screen_tuner.png" alt="Tuner Screenshot" class="tuner-screenshot"
          style="border: 3px solid #4CAF50; transition: border-color 0.5s ease-in-out, border-radius 10px; border-radius: 10px;"
          onmouseover="this.style.borderColor='#FF5733'" onmouseout="this.style.borderColor='#4CAF50'">
      </div>

      <h3>Clear Articulation</h3>
      <p>The latest feature of the Music Education Interface I am working on introduces <strong>articulation
          assessment</strong>. A state-of-the-art digital signal processing algorithm measures the <strong>attack
          transient duration</strong> in milliseconds, providing users with real-time feedback on their articulation
        clarity.</p>
      <blockquote style="font-style: italic; border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50; padding-left: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">
        "Attack clarity is finding the purity and the best beginning of sound"
      </blockquote>

      <p>Achieving a clean and controlled attack is a crucial skill for musicians, influencing both technical precision
        and artistic expression. The articulation analysis tool enables users to experiment with different attack styles
        (e.g., <strong>staccato, détaché, martelé</strong>) while receiving real-time feedback on their performance. By
        analyzing the transient development of their sound, students gain deeper control over articulation, allowing
        them to make more informed musical choices and refine their expressive capabilities.</p>
      <p><strong>Audio Examples!</strong></p>
      <p>Compare the difference between an unclear and a clean articulation:</p>
      <div class="audio-container">
        <div class="audio-example">
          <p><strong>Unclean Attack</strong></p>
          <audio controls>
            <source src="assets/unclean_attack.wav" type="audio/wav">

        <div class="audio-example">

            Your browser does not support the audio element.
          </audio>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Enhancing Sound Quality with Machine Learning</h3>
      <p>To further refine the student's technique, a machine learning model was integrated into the learning interface
        to classify sounds based on their timbral quality. This functionality introduces a new layer of complexity,
        helping users develop their musical competencies.

      <h1>Hearing Care Platform</h1>
      <p>The <strong>Hearing Care Platform (HCP)</strong> is an initiative aimed at raising awareness about noise
        exposure and hearing health, particularly among musicians.
        <!-- It was developed through a collaboration between CIRMMT, the NSERC-EERS Industrial Research Chair in In-Ear Technologies (CRITIAS) at École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), and the Schulich School of Music at McGill University. -->
      </p>

      <h2>App Development</h2>
      <p>As part of this project, a <strong>custom mobile app</strong> was developed to help musicians and individuals
        assess their sound exposure from both music and non-music activities. The app provides a personalized assessment
        of listening habits and potential hearing risks.</p>


      <h2>User Research and Development</h2>
      <p>In addition to the app, a <strong>measuring kiosk</strong> was launched, allowing participants to analyze their
        headphone listening levels using their own devices. This approach ensures a more accurate and personalized
        assessment of hearing exposure.</p>

      <div class="hcp-gallery">

        <img src="assets/HCP3.png" alt="HCP Setup">
      </div>

      <p>As part of this initiative, research was conducted to refine the platform's effectiveness in promoting hearing
        conservation. The project involved leading <strong>user research sessions</strong> with musicians and students
        to evaluate their sound exposure levels and gather insights on hearing care practices.</p>

      <p>By combining innovative technology with real-world data collection, this platform contributes to the broader
        goal of improving hearing health awareness and influencing hearing conservation policies.</p>
