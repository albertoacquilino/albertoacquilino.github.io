    <p><strong>MEI-Trumpet</strong> is an educational web application developed to help music students learn proper fingering and sound production techniques on trumpet. 
    <a href="https://mei-trumpet.web.app/" target="_blank"><strong>Click HERE to try MEI-Trumpet now!</strong></a>
</p>
-->
    <p><strong>MEI-Trumpet</strong> is an educational web application that supports users in mastering musical competencies. The app facilitates learning through guided repetition, structured reflection, and multi-sensory engagement, addressing critical technical and auditory skills.</p>
    <p>By allowing students to set custom parameters, MEI-Trumpet adapts to different skill levels, creating a <strong>personalized learning experience</strong>. 
      Starting with a beginner-friendly interface, users can customize their practice by selecting:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>⏰ <strong>Metronome Speed:</strong> Adjust the tempo for practice.</li>
        <li>🎵 <strong>Lowest Note & Highest Note:</strong> Define a custom range of notes to focus on.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The image below shows the interactive controls where students can set these parameters before starting an exercise.</p>

    <div class="input-image">
      <img src="assets/input.jpg" alt="Input Parameters for Tempo and Note Range" 
           class="input-screenshot" onclick="toggleImageSize(this)">
    </div>

    <p>Each exercise is structured in three steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first measure is a rest, allowing the student to prepare</li>
      <li>The second measure plays a reference note, offering an example to imitate</li>
      <li>The third measure is for the user to play the note</li>
    </ul>

    <p>On the top of the screen, an image showing the correct trumpet fingering, including adjustments for the third valve slide, is displayed. This helps students easily associate the note shown on the musical staff with the corresponding pitch and valve combination.</p>

    <h2>Research Background</h2>
    <p>MEI-Trumpet is part of a research project led by Alberto Acquilino at the Schulich School of Music of McGill University, in collaboration with the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF). Ongoing studies aim to further define the pedagogical foundations of the interface and discuss its usability and social validity through groups of participants.</p>

    <p><strong>The source code for the app is publicly available <a href="https://github.com/albertoacquilino/music-education-interface-ionic/tree/gsoc-2024" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>

    <p>MEI-Trumpet is available as a free beta version for both web and mobile devices:</p>

  <p>Once users get the hang of playing the right note, scaffolding helps them take it to the next level!<p>
  <p>Adding a chromatic tuner and dynamic markings, users are encouraged to fine-tune their pitch and volume control bringing more expression and style to their playing.</p>

  </div>

  <p>To further refine the student's technique, a machine learning model was integrated into the learning interface to classify sounds based on their timbral quality. This functionality introduces a new layer of complexity, helping users develop their musical competencies.

  <h1>Hearing Care Platform</h1>
  <p>The <strong>Hearing Care Platform (HCP)</strong> is an initiative aimed at raising awareness about noise exposure and hearing health, particularly among musicians. 
    <!-- It was developed through a collaboration between CIRMMT, the NSERC-EERS Industrial Research Chair in In-Ear Technologies (CRITIAS) at École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), and the Schulich School of Music at McGill University. -->
  </p>

  <h2>App Development</h2>
  <p>As part of this project, a <strong>custom mobile app</strong> was developed to help musicians and individuals assess their sound exposure from both music and non-music activities. The app provides a personalized assessment of listening habits and potential hearing risks.</p>


  <h2>User Research and Development</h2>
  <p>In addition to the app, a <strong>measuring kiosk</strong> was launched, allowing participants to analyze their headphone listening levels using their own devices. This approach ensures a more accurate and personalized assessment of hearing exposure.</p>

    <img src="assets/HCP2.png" alt="HCP Screenshot 2">
    <img src="assets/HCP3.png" alt="HCP Setup">
  </div>

  <p>As part of this initiative, research was conducted to refine the platform's effectiveness in promoting hearing conservation. The project involved leading <strong>user research sessions</strong> with musicians and students to evaluate their sound exposure levels and gather insights on hearing care practices.</p>

  <p>By combining innovative technology with real-world data collection, this platform contributes to the broader goal of improving hearing health awareness and influencing hearing conservation policies.</p>
