      <h1 class="project-title">Sistema New Brunswick: Teaching Artist Residency <span class="project-subtitle">Individual Fieldwork Project — Global Leaders Institute (2022)</span></h1>

      <p><strong>Sistema New Brunswick: Teaching Artist Residency</strong> was an individual fieldwork project developed within the Global Leaders Institute (GLI) and carried out in collaboration with Sistema New Brunswick (SNB), one of the most successful El Sistema-inspired music education programs in North America. The project investigated how technology could expand and enhance the educational impact of intensive orchestral music programs, particularly in socially engaged learning environments.</p>

      <h2>What it did</h2>
      <p>The project combined field observation, pedagogical analysis and technological exploration to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyze the educational model of Sistema New Brunswick, focusing on its intensive, daily and fully inclusive approach to music education</li>
        <li>Evaluate student learning outcomes through direct observation of rehearsals, teaching practices and public performances</li>
        <li>Explore the potential role of educational technology in supporting instrumental learning, particularly for bowed string and wind instruments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The work highlighted how structured orchestral training fostered not only musical skills, but also social responsibility, collaboration, discipline and community engagement.</p>

      <h2>How it worked</h2>
      <p>In the spring of 2022, I conducted in-person fieldwork at the Saint John and Moncton music centers of Sistema New Brunswick. As part of the GLI cohort, my role involved:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Observing daily rehearsals and classes across different age groups</li>
        <li>Collaborating with teachers and conductors, discussing pedagogical strategies and challenges</li>
        <li>Evaluating student performances, including the end-of-year public concert</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Despite students having only a few years of musical experience (in some cases just nine months of ensemble practice), the overall performance quality was remarkably high. This outcome reflected the commitment of teachers, the structured methodology and the full engagement of families within the program.</p>

      <h2>Key results</h2>
      <p>The fieldwork identified several core strengths of the Sistema New Brunswick model:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Daily, free, intensive instruction, allowing teachers to monitor progress continuously</li>
        <li>Early correction of technical issues such as embouchure and posture, preventing the formation of bad habits</li>
        <li>Strong organizational alignment, from board members to teachers and conductors, centered on student well-being</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, discussions with teachers revealed a strong interest in technology-based tools that could support learning outside classroom hours.</p>

      <!--
      <h2>Technology and innovation</h2>
      <p>A central outcome of the project was the identification of a concrete opportunity for audio-based educational technology. Teachers expressed enthusiasm for software capable of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visualizing performance feedback using audio signal processing tools</li>
        <li>Providing real-time feedback based on timbre</li>
        <li>Supporting individual practice during after-school or weekend sessions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Such tools, grounded in acoustic resonance principles, could significantly enhance instrumental learning. This concept was being advanced at the Music Technology Center at McGill University, with full support and planned future testing from Sistema New Brunswick teachers.</p>
      -->

      <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p>This project demonstrated how collaboration between academic research centers and community-based music programs could drive meaningful educational innovation. By integrating pedagogy, social impact and technology, the work opened a dialogue and created a network for future collaborations to improve learning outcomes for both students and teachers.</p>
      <p>The fieldwork confirmed that technology—when designed in close dialogue with educators—could become a powerful extension of intensive music education models like El Sistema, amplifying their impact for future generations.</p>
