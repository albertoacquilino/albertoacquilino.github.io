            <h1>Hearing Care Platform</h1>
            <p>The <strong>Hearing Care Platform (HCP)</strong> is an initiative aimed at raising awareness about noise
                exposure and hearing health, particularly among musicians.
                <!-- It was developed through a collaboration between CIRMMT, the NSERC-EERS Industrial Research Chair in In-Ear Technologies (CRITIAS) at École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), and the Schulich School of Music at McGill University. -->
            </p>

            <h2>App Development</h2>
            <p>As part of this project, a <strong>custom mobile app</strong> was developed to help musicians and
                individuals
                assess their sound exposure from both music and non-music activities. The app provides a personalized
                assessment
                of listening habits and potential hearing risks.</p>


            <h2>User Research and Development</h2>
            <p>In addition to the app, a <strong>measuring kiosk</strong> was launched, allowing participants to analyze
                their
                headphone listening levels using their own devices. This approach ensures a more accurate and
                personalized
                assessment of hearing exposure.</p>

            </div>

            <p>As part of this initiative, research was conducted to refine the platform's effectiveness in promoting
                hearing
                conservation. The project involved leading <strong>user research sessions</strong> with musicians and
                students
                to evaluate their sound exposure levels and gather insights on hearing care practices.</p>

            <p>By combining innovative technology with real-world data collection, this platform contributes to the
                broader
                goal of improving hearing health awareness and influencing hearing conservation policies.</p>
