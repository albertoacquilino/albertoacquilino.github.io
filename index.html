      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>Alberto Acquilino is a Western Postdoctoral Fellow in Music Education at the Don Wright Faculty of Music of
        Western University, Canada. His career reflects an uncommon blend of artistry and science, uniting his training as a
        musician with his expertise in engineering and technology. After earning a degree in music performance from the
        Paganini Conservatory of Music in Italy, he established himself as a performer, conductor and music educator. At
        the same time, he pursued his interest in engineering, completing two master’s degrees in mechanical engineering
        in Italy and France and conducting research at ETH Zurich in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Alberto pursued a PhD in Music Technology at McGill University in the Computational Acoustic Modeling
        Laboratory. His doctoral research explored how digital technologies can enrich instrumental pedagogy, leading to
        the creation of open-source frameworks for real-time feedback and adaptive learning in music education. His
        current research examines how algorithmic and AI-assisted composition and disability-led design can enhance
        access in music learning.</p>
      <p>In addition to his research, Alberto has been active as a teacher and mentor. He served as a Lecturer in Music
        Technology at McGill University, where he also gave guest lectures in music education classes on brass pedagogy,
        advanced wind techniques and educational applications of technology. He is currently a member of the Academic
        Board of the Global Leaders Institute MBA, teaching courses on emerging technologies for innovation and
        contributing to the conference series The Musician as Innovator.</p>
      <p>Alberto’s work extends well beyond the university setting. As a Lead Mentor with the Neuroinformatics
        Coordinating Facility for the Google Summer of Code program, he guides international open-source initiatives
        dedicated to developing adaptive and inclusive music-learning tools. Across his teaching, research and community
        engagement, he is committed to bringing together artistic practice, technological innovation and social impact
        to foster accessible and equitable music education.</p>

      <h1>Music Education Interface: MEI-Trumpet</h1>
      <p>I am excited to present my new music education app, MEI-Trumpet. Aiming to expand the potential of trumpet
        teachers, the app contains
        interactive exercises and practice tools devised to enhance the learning experience of trumpet students. This
        application is a work in progress,
        where several functionalities will be added through constant updates. Please, consider testing it and providing
        constructive feedback,
        whether publicly or privately, to help me improve it.</p>
      <p>MEI-Trumpet is freely available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mei-trumpet/id6452315691"
          target="_blank">Apple Store</a> and in the <a
