      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>The app provides customizable exercises where users can specify the metronome value and the desired note range:
      </p>

      <div class="input-image">
        <img src="assets/input.jpg" alt="Input Parameters for Tempo and Note Range" class="input-screenshot">
      </div>

      <p>Each exercise is structured in three steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first measure is a rest, allowing the student to prepare.</li>
        <li>The second measure plays a reference note, offering an example to imitate.</li>
        <li>The third measure is for the user to play the note.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>On the top of the screen, an image showing the correct trumpet fingering, including adjustments for the third
        valve slide, is displayed. This helps students easily associate the note shown on the musical staff with the
        corresponding pitch and valve combination.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Other features include the option to add a chromatic tuner and dynamic markings (<i>p</i>, <i>mf</i>,
        <i>f</i>), expanding the possibilities of different exercises that can be created within the interface. Users
        can optionally register via email to track their progress, with performance data collected to help monitor
        improvement over time.</p>
